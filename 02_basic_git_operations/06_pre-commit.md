## Pre-commit (0:06)


Maybe this situation should sound familiar to you: you've added new code, committed it, and pushed it to GitHub. You're ready to open a pull request, but you forgot to run the linter beforehand the CI threw an error. What if you could catch those errors before you even commit your code? That's what pre-commit is for!
