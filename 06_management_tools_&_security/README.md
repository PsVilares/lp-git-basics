# Management tools and security

Git's functionality extends beyond code version control, playing a critical role in team dynamics and project management. Effective team management within Git environments isn't just about handling code; it's about managing the people and processes that contribute to a project's success. This section is designed to turn theoretical knowledge into practical tools, ensuring you can lead and operate within a productive team setting.

In this part, we will explore the essential techniques and strategies for optimizing your team's workflow and safeguarding your project's integrity:

1. [Managing collaborators](01_managing_collaborators.md), because a well-managed team is a productive one.
2. [Branch permissions](02_branch_permissions.md): protect your branches against sloppy or unintentional work.
3. [Project management tools](03_management_tools.md): even though Github and GitLab do not particularly excel at this task, for simple enough projects they provide an all-in-one place to develop your project.
4. [Removing sensitive data](04_removing_sensitive_data.md): git remembers all your history. This means that if at some point you accidentally included sensitive data and then removed it, it will still be saved in the history. We will see how to remove them for good.
