# Collaborative Git Workflows

Automation and continuous integration (CI) pipelines are at the heart of modern software development, allowing teams to deliver more reliable and robust software faster. In this section, we delve into how GitHub and GitLab facilitate these practices, transforming the way teams build, test, and deploy their applications. This guide is tailored to provide you with the skills and knowledge necessary to harness the full potential of automation and CI pipelines within your projects.

In this segment, we will cover key aspects of automation and security in software delivery:

1. Automating processes with Github and Gitlab [ci pipelines](01_ci_pipelines.md).
2. Using Github and Gitlab's [secrets](02_secrets.md) to protect sensitive information in the automated processes.
